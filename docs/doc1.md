# Gateways

Gateways are Discord's form of real-time communication over secure websockets. Clients will receive events and data over the gateway they are connected to and send data over the REST API. The API for interacting with Gateways is complex and fairly unforgiving, therefore it's highly recommended you read _all_ of the following documentation before writing a custom implementation.

The Discord Gateway has a versioning system which is separate from the core APIs. The documentation herein is only for the latest version in the following table, unless otherwise specified.

###### Gateway Versions

| Version | Status       |
| ------- | ------------ |

###### Gateway Payload Structure

| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                     | Present           |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| op    | integer                 | [opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-opcodes) for the payload | Always            |
| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | event data                                                                      | Always            |
| s     | integer                 | sequence number, used for resuming sessions and heartbeats                      | Only for Opcode 0 |
| t     | string                  | the event name for this payload                                                 | Only for Opcode 0 |

### Sending Payloads

Packets sent from the client to the Gateway API are encapsulated within a [gateway payload object](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-payloads-example-gateway-dispatch) and must have the proper opcode and data object set. The payload object can then be serialized in the format of choice (see [ETF/JSON](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/etfjson)), and sent over the websocket. Payloads to the gateway are limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes sent, going over this will cause a connection termination with error code 4002.

###### Example Gateway Dispatch

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "d": {},
  "s": 42,
  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"
}
```

### Receiving Payloads

Receiving payloads with the Gateway API is slightly more complex than sending. When using the JSON encoding with compression enabled, the Gateway has the option of sending payloads as compressed JSON binaries using zlib, meaning your library _must_ detect (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)) and decompress these payloads before attempting to parse them. The gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent.

## Encoding and Compression

#### ETF/JSON

When initially creating and handshaking connections to the Gateway, a user can choose whether they wish to communicate over plain-text JSON or binary [ETF](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist.html). When using ETF, the client must not send compressed messages to the server. Note that Snowflake IDs are transmitted as 64-bit integers over ETF, but are transmitted as strings over JSON. See [erlpack](https://github.com/discordapp/erlpack) for an implementation example.

#### Payload Compression

When using JSON encoding with payload compression enabled (`compress: true` in identify), the Gateway may optionally send zlib-compressed payloads (see [RFC1950 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950#section-2.2)). Your library _must_ detect and decompress these payloads to plain-text JSON before attempting to parse them. If you are using payload compression, the gateway does not implement a shared compression context between messages sent. Payload compression will be disabled if you use transport compression (see below).

#### Transport Compression

Currently the only available transport compression option is `zlib-stream`. You will need to run all received packets through a shared zlib context, as seen in the example below. Every connection to the gateway should use its own unique zlib context.

###### Transport Compression Example

```python
# Z_SYNC_FLUSH suffix
ZLIB_SUFFIX = b'\x00\x00\xff\xff'
# initialize a buffer to store chunks
buffer = bytearray()
# create a zlib inflation context to run chunks through
inflator = zlib.decompressobj()

# ...
def on_websocket_message(msg):
  # always push the message data to your cache
  buffer.extend(msg)

  # check if the last four bytes are equal to ZLIB_SUFFIX
  if len(msg) < 4 or msg[-4:] != ZLIB_SUFFIX:
    return

  # if the message *does* end with ZLIB_SUFFIX,
  # get the full message by decompressing the buffers
  msg = inflator.decompress(buffer).decode('utf-8')
  buffer = bytearray()

  # here you can treat `msg` as either JSON or ETF encoded,
  # depending on your `encoding` param
```

| v         | integer | Gateway Version to use                        | 6 (see [Gateway versions](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-versions)) |
| encoding  | string  | The encoding of recieved gateway packets      | 'json' or 'etf'                                                   |
| compress? | string  | The (optional) compression of gateway packets | 'zlib-stream'                                                     |

The first step in establishing connectivity to the gateway is requesting a valid websocket endpoint from the API. This can be done through either the [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway) or the [Get Gateway Bot](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway-bot) endpoint.

With the resulting payload, you can now open a websocket connection to the "url" (or endpoint) specified. Generally, it is a good idea to explicitly pass the gateway version and encoding. For example, we may connect to `wss://gateway.discord.gg/?v=6&encoding=json`.

Once connected, the client should immediately receive an [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload, with information on the connection's heartbeat interval:

###### Example Gateway Hello

```json
{
  "heartbeat_interval": 45000,
  "_trace": ["discord-gateway-prd-1-99"]
}
```

### Heartbeating

The client should now begin sending [Opcode 1 Heartbeat](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeat) payloads every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds, until the connection is eventually closed or terminated. This OP code is also bidirectional. The gateway may request a heartbeat from you in some situations, and you should send a heartbeat back to the gateway as you normally would.

> info
> In the event of a service outage where you stay connected to the gateway, you should continue to heartbeat and receive ACKs. The gateway will eventually respond and issue a session once it's able to.

Clients can detect zombied or failed connections by listening for [Opcode 11 Heartbeat ACK](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/heartbeating-example-gateway-heartbeat-ack):

###### Example Gateway Heartbeat ACK

```json
{
  "op": 11
}
```

If a client does not receive a heartbeat ack between its attempts at sending heartbeats, it should immediately terminate the connection with a non-1000 close code, reconnect, and attempt to resume.

### Identifying

Next, the client is expected to send an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify):

###### Example Gateway Identify

This is a minimal `IDENTIFY` payload. `IDENTIFY` supports additional optional fields for other session properties, such as payload compression, or an initial presence state. See [Example Identify](#DOCS_GATEWAY/identify-example-identify) for a more complete example.

```json
{
  "token": "my_token",
  "properties": {
    "$os": "linux",
    "$browser": "my_library",
    "$device": "my_library"
  }
}
```

If the payload is valid, the gateway will respond with a [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event. Your client is now considered in a "connected" state. Clients are limited to 1 identify every 5 seconds; if they exceed this limit, the gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session). It is important to note that although the ready event contains a large portion of the required initial state, some information (such as guilds and their members) is sent asynchronously (see [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) event).

> warn
> Clients are limited to 1000 `IDENTIFY` calls to the websocket in a 24-hour period. This limit is global and across all shards, but does not include `RESUME` calls. Upon hitting this limit, all active sessions for the bot will be terminated, the bot's token will be reset, and the owner will receive an email notification. It's up to the owner to update their application with the new token.

## Resuming

The internet is a scary place. Disconnections happen, especially with persistent connections. Due to Discord's architecture, this is a semi-regular event and should be expected and handled. Discord has a process for "resuming" (or reconnecting) a connection that allows the client to replay any lost events from the last sequence number they received in the exact same way they would receive them normally.

Your client should store the `session_id` from the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready), and the sequence number of the last event it received. When your client detects that it has been disconnected, it should completely close the connection and open a new one (following the same strategy as [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting)). Once the new connection has been opened, the client should send a [Gateway Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume):

###### Example Gateway Resume

```json
{
  "token": "my_token",
  "session_id": "session_id_i_stored",
  "seq": 1337
}
```

If successful, the gateway will respond by replaying all missed events in order, finishing with a [Resumed](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resumed) event to signal replay has finished, and all subsequent events are new. It's also possible that your client cannot reconnect in time to resume, in which case the client will receive a [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session) and is expected to wait a random amount of time—between 1 and 5 seconds—then send a fresh [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify).

### Disconnections

If the gateway ever issues a disconnect to your client, it will provide a close event code that you can use to properly handle the disconnection. A full list of these close codes can be found in the [Response Codes](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-close-event-codes) documentation.

## Rate Limiting

Clients are allowed 120 events every 60 seconds, meaning you can send on average at a rate of up to 2 events per second. Clients who surpass this limit are immediately disconnected from the Gateway, and similarly to the HTTP API, repeat offenders will have their API access revoked. Clients are also limited to one gateway connection per 5 seconds. If you hit this limit, the Gateway will respond with an [Opcode 9 Invalid Session](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/invalid-session).

## Tracking State

Most of a client's state is provided during the initial [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/ready) event and the [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events that immediately follow. As objects are further created/updated/deleted, other events are sent to notify the client of these changes and to provide the new or updated data. To avoid excessive API calls, Discord expects clients to locally cache as many object states as possible, and to update them as gateway events are received.

An example of state tracking can be found with member status caching. When initially connecting to the gateway, the client receives information regarding the online status of guild members (online, idle, dnd, offline). To keep this state updated, a client must track and parse [Presence Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/presence-update) events as they are received, and apply the provided data to the cached member objects.

## Guild Availability

When connecting to the gateway as a bot user, guilds that the bot is a part of start out as unavailable. Don't fret! The gateway will automatically attempt to reconnect on your behalf. As guilds become available to you, you will receive [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events.

## Sharding

As bots grow and are added to an increasing number of guilds, some developers may find it necessary to break or split portions of their bots operations into separate logical processes. As such, Discord gateways implement a method of user-controlled guild sharding which allows for splitting events across a number of gateway connections. Guild sharding is entirely user controlled, and requires no state-sharing between separate connections to operate.

To enable sharding on a connection, the user should send the `shard` array in the [Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify) payload. The first item in this array should be the zero-based integer value of the current shard, while the second represents the total number of shards. DMs will only be sent to shard 0. To calculate what events will be sent to what shard, the following formula can be used:

###### Sharding Formula

```python
(guild_id >> 22) % num_shards == shard_id
```

As an example, if you wanted to split the connection between three shards, you'd use the following values for `shard` for each connection: `[0, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[2, 3]`. Note that only the first shard (`[0, 3]`) would receive DMs.

## Sharding for Very Large Bots

If you own a bot that is in over 100,000 guilds, there are some additional considerations you must take around sharding. We will contact you if you are required to adhere to these changes.

The number of shards you run must be a multiple of a fixed number we will determine when reaching out to you. If you attempt to start your bot with an invalid number of shards, your websocket connection will close with a 4010 Invalid Shard opcode. The gateway bot bootstrap endpoint will return the correct amount of shards, so if you're already using this endpoint to determine your number of shards, you shouldn't require any further changes.

The session start limit for these bots will also be increased from 1000 to 2000 per day. Finally, the [Get Current User Guilds](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint will no longer return results for your bot. We will be creating a new endpoint that is more shard-aware to iterate through your bot's guilds if needed.

### Event Names

Event names are in standard constant form, fully upper-cased and replacing all spaces with underscores. For instance, [Channel Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) would be `CHANNEL_CREATE` and [Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/voice-state-update) would be `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`. Within the following documentation they have been left in standard English form to aid in readability.

#### Identify

    },
    "status": "dnd",
    "since": 91879201,
    "afk": false
  }
}
```

#### Resume

Used to replay missed events when a disconnected client resumes.

###### Resume Structure

| Field      | Type    | Description                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| token      | string  | session token                 |

###### Example Resume

```json
{
  "token": "randomstring",
  "session_id": "evenmorerandomstring",
  "seq": 1337
}
```

#### Heartbeat

Used to maintain an active gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.

###### Example Heartbeat

```
{
	"op": 1,
	"d": 251
}
```

#### Request Guild Members

Used to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, the gateway will only send offline members if a guild has less than the `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)). If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.

###### Guild Request Members Structure

| Field    | Type                             | Description                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| guild_id | snowflake or array of snowflakes | id of the guild(s) to get members for                                      |
| query    | string                           | string that username starts with, or an empty string to return all members |
| limit    | integer                          | maximum number of members to send or 0 to request all members matched      |

###### Guild Request Members

```json
{
  "guild_id": "41771983444115456",
  "query": "",
  "limit": 0
}
```

###### Hello Structure

| Field              | Type             | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "heartbeat_interval": 45000,
  "_trace": ["discord-gateway-prd-1-99"]
}
```

#### Ready

The ready event is dispatched when a client has completed the initial handshake with the gateway (for new sessions). The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.

`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/guild-create) events. `private_channels` will be an empty array. As bots receive private messages, they will be notified via [Channel Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/channel-create) events.

###### Ready Event Fields

#### Resumed

The resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).

###### Resumed Event Fields

| Field   | Type             | Description                                    |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \_trace | array of strings | used for debugging - the guilds the user is in |

#### Invalid Session

Sent to indicate one of at least three different situations:

- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/identify)
- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resume)
- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action

The inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting) and [Resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) for more information.

###### Example Gateway Invalid Session

```json
{
  "op": 9,
  "d": false
}
```

### Channels

#### Channel Create

Sent when a new channel is created, relevant to the current user. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object.

#### Channel Update

Sent when a channel is updated. The inner payload is a [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object. This is not sent when the field `last_message_id` is altered. To keep track of the last_message_id changes, you must listen for [Message Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/message-create) events.

## Get Gateway % GET /gateway

> info
> This endpoint does not require authentication.

Returns an object with a single valid WSS URL, which the client can use for [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting). Clients **should** cache this value and only call this endpoint to retrieve a new URL if they are unable to properly establish a connection using the cached version of the URL.

###### Example Response

```json
{
  "url": "wss://gateway.discord.gg/"
}
```

## Get Gateway Bot % GET /gateway/bot

> warn
> This endpoint requires authentication using a valid bot token.

Returns an object based on the information in [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway), plus additional metadata that can help during the operation of large or [sharded](#DOCS_TOPIC_GATEWAY/sharding) bots. Unlike the [Get Gateway](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/get-gateway), this route should not be cached for extended periods of time as the value is not guaranteed to be the same per-call, and changes as the bot joins/leaves guilds.
